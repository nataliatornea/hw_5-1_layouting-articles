                <h2>The Trees Change Color. The Weather Is Perfect</h2>
                <p><strong><em>Fall is my favorite season. Who doesn't enjoy observing the leaves from the trees and plants 
                changing into multi-colored works of art before finally falling away?<br> 
                The bare and vulnerable branches that are created reveal the true and beautiful scenery underneath. 
                There are many reasons why I love fall and why I think it's the best season, but here are just a few.</em></strong></p>
                <p>In the southern part of the United States, all the seasons are very apparent. The spring season is 
                very green, the summer is very hot, the winter is very cold and the fall is full of magnificent colors. 
                <p>The maple trees are especially vibrant with colors of red and golden-yellow and combinations of both. 
                When I was younger, we called them "tree stars," a reference to the movie The Land Before Time. To this 
                day, they are my favorite trees when the season changes.</p>
               <p>This season is perfect for taking beautiful scenic photos and spending time outdoors. Nothing can relax and 
                rejuvenate you more than enjoying nature and its surrounding scenery.</p>  
                <p>Autumn is the "cooling off" month right between the blazing summer and chilling winter. When the cooler 
                temperatures of fall start rolling in, saying goodbye to summer is not hard to do. Autumn is a great time 
                to break out the jackets, coats, boots, scarves and hats in preparation for the change in season.</p>
                <p>It's also the perfect time to start making hot cocoa and lighting a fire in the fireplace. This season 
                creates the perfect setting for a sense of comfort, warmth and reflection.</p>
                <p>It's also great time to go camping or fishing or take a road trip or anything else where you can spend quality 
                time with family while eating good food.</p>
