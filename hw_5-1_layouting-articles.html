                <h2>The Trees Change Color. The Weather Is Perfect</h2>
                <p><strong><em>Fall is my favorite season. Who doesn't enjoy observing the leaves from the trees and plants 
                changing into multi-colored works of art before finally falling away? The bare and vulnerable branches that 
                are created reveal the true and beautiful scenery underneath. 
                There are many reasons why I love fall and why I think it's the best season, but here are just a few.</em></strong></p>
                <p>In the southern part of the United States, all the seasons are very apparent. The spring season is 
                very green, the summer is very hot, the winter is very cold and the fall is full of magnificent colors. 
                <p>The maple trees are especially vibrant with colors of red and golden-yellow and combinations of both. 
                When I was younger, we called them "tree stars," a reference to the movie The Land Before Time. To this 
                day, they are my favorite trees when the season changes.</p>
                <p>This season is perfect for taking beautiful scenic photos and spending time outdoors. Nothing can relax and 
                rejuvenate you more than enjoying nature and its surrounding scenery.</p>  
                <p>Autumn is the "cooling off" month right between the blazing summer and chilling winter. When the cooler 
                temperatures of fall start rolling in, saying goodbye to summer is not hard to do. Autumn is a great time 
                to break out the jackets, coats, boots, scarves and hats in preparation for the change in season.</p>
                <p>It's also the perfect time to start making hot cocoa and lighting a fire in the fireplace. This season 
                creates the perfect setting for a sense of comfort, warmth and reflection.</p>
                <p>It's also great time to go camping or fishing or take a road trip or anything else where you can spend quality 
                time with family while eating good food.</p>

                <h2>The Seasonal Shopping Is Awesome</h2>
                <p><strong><em>During the fall you can expect to see your favorite stores load up their inventory with themes related 
                    to this time of year. Everything from pumpkin-flavored pies and Starbucks drinks to apple ciders and new fragrances 
                    and clothes hit the shelves. Below are a few fall essentials that you shouldn't be caught without.</em></strong></p>
                   <p>Must-Have Fall Shopping Essentials
                    Flannel Shirts. Although they exhibit year-round versatility, flannels are a fall staple.
                    Lotion. Cold weather means dry skin. Counter the elements with yummy, seasonal scents.
                    Soup. When is there a better time of year to eat soup (besides winter)?
                    Cold Weather Boots. Everyone needs a go-to pair of boots that are not only fashionable, but can tackle any ice, rain, or chilly weather.</p> 
                    <p>Fall Is Full of Family Holidays. 
                        Autumn is a part of of the jam-packed holiday season. There's the back-to-school rush, Halloween, and Thanksgiving before rolling into 
                        winter and Christmas. And these aren't just regular old holidays. These are all very involved, family-centered holidays.
                        Autumn is the season to be thankful and to be surrounded by the people you love. It's the perfect time to change up your decorations 
                        by adding orange, red and yellow colors and to pull out the spice-scented candles.
                        The holiday season encourages you to spend time thinking about what you and your family have been through in the last year as well as 
                        the memories you've made together while looking forward to a new and exciting year.
                        Another reason I love the holidays is the food. You'll generally eat far better food during this season than you will during the rest of the year.</p>
